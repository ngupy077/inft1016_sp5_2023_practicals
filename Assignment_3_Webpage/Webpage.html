                Quantum computer has showed its advantages in solving multiple complex problems as well as its purposes in various 
                subjects, incuding science, healthcare, businesses, and the advance of AI training and auto-manufacturing. Quantum 
                computing is also expected to be used more in the future in aerospace researching, automobile vehicles, together with 
                building VR and AR environments for several approach.
