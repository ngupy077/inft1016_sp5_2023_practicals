                        Quantum computer has showed its advantages in solving multiple complex problems as well as its purposes in various 
                        subjects, incuding science, healthcare, businesses, along with the advance of AI training and auto-manufacturing. Quantum 
                        computing is also expected to be used more in the future in aerospace researching, automobile vehicles, together with 
                        building VR and AR environments for several approach.

                        With an aim to support enterprises and global organizations, quantum computers are equipped and processed via
                        numerous of Quantum bits (or Qubits), which allow the machines to work efficiently to come out with accurate answers in the shortest amount of time needed.
                        This make quantum computers extremely effective in analyzing and manipulating multiple tasks that require innovative 
                        and possible solution in a short duration.

                    <p style="color: rgb(126, 218, 211); text-align: left; font: 1.1em/1.1 Times New Roman, sans-serif">
                        Well, technically you cannot build a quantum computer at home, since its requirements varies in a wide range from building material to 
                        maintaining and keeping the machine to functioning efficiently. But if you earn enough, and really want to have one,
                        building your own quantum computer will not be a dream anymore.
